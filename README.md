# ChartsTest

- When using CocoaPods, I should add 'pod 'Charts'' to my Podfile.
- And when using Carthage, the webpage says about how to use this.
  ->  Charts now include Carthage prebuilt binaries.
      github "danielgindi/Charts" == 3.2.1
      github "danielgindi/Charts" ~> 3.2.1
      In order to build the binaries for a new release, use carthage build --no-skip-current && carthage archive Charts.
- And when I want to add library manually, I have to do some stuff like adding some projects into my projects.
  
- I used CocoaPods to set the development environment to use Charts library.
